# Xmas Tree Lights

A Raspberry Pi with single-addressable RGB LEDs for my Christmas tree.

## Why?

A few years ago, while staring at a broken strand of conventional
Christmas tree lights and thinking about planning a search
for the one broken bulb, I wondered why we were still
lighting trees using simple incandescent lamps.

Because, you know, the computer age and all?

Now, of course, proper LED-based lights have been available for a while, 
but they were surprisingly simplistic. I wanted programmable lights!

Which brings us here.

## Google to the rescue

This project is based off of the following very helpful web page
from [adafruit.com](https://adafruit.com)

Jump over there for some really cool projects.

## Design

This is the design from the link above, redrawn as a schematic,
and inserted here to give this project some badly needed 
legitimacy. It doesn't really work, because the circuit is
very simple.

## Hardware

Here is a source for the lights I used. A strand of 50 sounds
like plenty, but each pair of bulbs is separated by just a few inches,
and so one strand covers very little area. I bought two and tied
them together in series.

## Software

To use the simple Python scripts included here, you'll need the rpi_ws281x module. My copy
of this code is included, but you probably want to go to the source.

## Automation

I used [zdaemon](https://pypi.org/project/zdaemon/) to install a Python script
as a service on the Raspberry Pi.
